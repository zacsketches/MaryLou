1. Start here on Due and motor shield
     http://arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/DueMotorShieldDC

2. Great ref for quadrature encoding
    http://letsmakerobots.com/node/24031

3. The plant will need to attach two encoder motors and
subscribe to the control_effort message.  It will
publish a plant status message with the following fields
    long rt_ct
    float rt_I //mv
    long lt_ct
    float lt_I
    uint32_t timestamp   //microseconds
    
5. Consider having the plant balance counts between the
two motors.
    
4. The attitude computer will have an IMU object 
attached to it and will need to publish a message
called attitude with the following data:
    int phi    //pitch neg falling back, pos frwd
    uint32_t timestamp   //microseconds
    
5. The state observer will subscribe to the 
attitude message and the plant_status_msg and publish
the state_vec_msg with the following fields
    int theta
    int theta_dot
    int x
    int x_dot
    
6. The balance regulator will subscribe to the 
state_vec_msg and publish the control_effort_msg
with the following field:
    int u
    
7. Have clearinghouse use publish_serial on the
messages of interest for debugging.
