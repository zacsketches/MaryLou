Notes for printing the structures that comprise MaryLou.

1. 2.5mm holes printed with shells 2 layers thick on low detail setting
are threadable with #4-40 machine screws.

2. 4mm holes easily pass #4 screws.

3. 6.5mm thickness on the platform with 15% infill is rigid enough
to not flex under the initial test conditions.
